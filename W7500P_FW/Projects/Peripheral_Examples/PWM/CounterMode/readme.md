### Example Description 

This example shows how to use the PWM peripheral to run counter mode.

The PWM channel 0 frequency is set to SystemCoreClock(Hz). SystemCoreClock is set to 20 MHz.

The PWM channel 0 is configured in rising edge counter mode, up-count mode, periodic mode. So the PWM channel 0 Timer/Counter is counted when input signal is triggered. 2 interrupts out of 3 interrupts are enabled: match and overflow interupt(capture interrupt is excepted).

The PWM channel 0 output pin(PC_00) is used for input.

When the Timer/Counter reaches the match value, RED LED(PC_08) is toggled every times, 
and when the Tiemr/Counter reaches the limit value, GREEN LED(PC_09) is toggled every times.

### Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example has been tested with WIZnet WIZwiki W7500 platform.
  - To select the WIZnet WIZwiki platform used to run the example.
  
  - WIZwiki W7500 Set-up
    - Use RED LED connected to PC_08 pin.
    - Use GREEN LED connected to PC_09 pin.
    - Use PC_00 for input signal.
    - In order to use the RED LED(PC_08) to be changed from PAD_AF0 to PAD_AF1.
    - In order to use the GREEN LED(PC_09) to be changed from PAD_AF0 to PAD_AF1.
    - In order to use the PC_00 to be changed from PAD_AF0 to PAD_AF2.
    - External input button has to be configured separately. 
  
### How to use it ?
