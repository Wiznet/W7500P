### Example Description 

This example shows how to use the Watchdog timer peripheral to run and generate watchdog reset request signal. External interrupt is used for generating hardfault and watchdog timer reset. EXTI line is mapped to PA_00

The Watchdog timer frequency is set to SystemCoreClock(Hz). SystemCoreClock is set to 20 MHz.
 
Reset information is checked at first, and then if reset is not occurred by watchdog timer, watchdog timer is set and started. Untill external interrupt is occurred, WDT counter is set and RED LED(PC_08) is toggled when WDT counter is under 0x1000.

If reset is occurred by watchdog timer, WDT interrupt is cleared and RED LED(PC_08) is off and GREEN LED(PC_09) is on.
