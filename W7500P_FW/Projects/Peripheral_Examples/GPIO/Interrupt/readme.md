### Example Description

This example shows how to configure GPIO Interrupt lines.
In this example, GPIO Interrupt is configured to generate an interrupt on each rising or falling edge. In the interrupt routine a LED connected to a specific GPIO pin is toggled.

In this example:
  - GPIO Interrupt line is mapped to PA.00

After GPIO Interrupt configuration, a software interrupt is generated on the GPIO Interrupt toggles LED(R).
After that, when rising edge is detected on GPIO Interrupt, LED(R) toggles.
If WIZwiki W7500 is used, when button is pressed, LED(R) toggles but, Button has to be configured separately.

### Hardware and Software environment

  - This example has been tested with WIZnet WIZwiki W7500 platform.
  - To select the WIZnet WIZwiki platform used to run the example.

  - WIZwiki W7500 Set-up
    - Use LED(R) connected to PC_08 pin.
    - Use GPIO Interrupt connected to PA_00 pin.
    - In order to use the LED to be changed from PAD_AF0 to PAD_AF1.
    - Button has to be configured separately.
