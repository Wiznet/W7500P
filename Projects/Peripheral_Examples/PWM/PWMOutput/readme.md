### Example Description 

This example shows how to use the PWM peripheral to generate PWM output signal.

The PWM channel 3, 4, 5 frequency is set to SystemCoreClock(Hz), the Prescaler is 2 
so the PWM channel 3, 4, 5 counter clock is 10 MHz. SystemCoreClock is set to 20 MHz.

The PWM channel 3, 4 is set as up-count and periodic mode and 5 is set as down-count and one-shot mode. So PWM channel 5 generates output signal once. The PWM channel 3, 4, 5 are all PWM output enabled.

The PWM channel 3 is configured in Timer Mode and duty cycle is 80 % and 4 is 30 %.

The PWM channel 3 is mapped to PA_06, 4 is mapped to PA_07 and 5 is mapped to PA_08.

### Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example has been tested with WIZnet WIZwiki W7500 platform.
  - To select the WIZnet WIZwiki platform used to run the example.
  
  - WIZwiki W7500 Set-up
    - PA_06 pin generates the PWM channel 4 output signal.
    - PA_07 pin generates the PWM channel 5 output signal.
    - PA_08 pin generates the PWM channel 6 output signal.    
    - In order to use the PWM channel 4(PA_06) to be changed from PAD_AF0 to PAD_AF3.
    - In order to use the PWM channel 5(PA_07) to be changed from PAD_AF0 to PAD_AF3.
    - In order to use the PWM channel 6(PA_08) to be changed from PAD_AF0 to PAD_AF3.    
  
### How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Open your preferred toolchain.
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.
 - WIZwiki W7500 where the Flash memory density ranges 128Kbytes.
