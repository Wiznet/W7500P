### Example Description 

This example shows how to use the PWM peripheral to run Dead-zone generation.

The PWM channel 0 frequency is set to SystemCoreClock(Hz), the Prescaler is 2 
so the PWM channel 0 counter clock is 10 MHz. SystemCoreClock is set to 20 MHz.

The PWM channel 0 is set as up-count and periodic mode, and the dead-zone counter value is set as 100. The PWM output is enabled. So as a result, the output of PWM channel 1 is inverted the PWM channel 0 output.

 - note:
   - If you want to use the PWM channel 0 as dead-zone generation, the PWM channel 1 output MUST be disabled.
  
The PWM channel 0 output is mapped to PC_00, and inverted output is mapped to PC_01(The PWM channel 1 output).

### Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example has been tested with WIZnet WIZwiki W7500 platform.
  - To select the WIZnet WIZwiki platform used to run the example.
  
  - WIZwiki W7500 Set-up
    - PA_00 pin generates the PWM channel 0 output signal.
    - PA_01 pin generates the inverted PWM channel 0 output signal.        
    - In order to use the PWM channel 0(PA_00) to be changed from PAD_AF0 to PAD_AF2.
    - In order to use the inverted PWM channel 0(PA_01) to be changed from PAD_AF0 to PAD_AF2.
  
### How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Open your preferred toolchain.
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.
 - WIZwiki W7500 where the Flash memory density ranges 128Kbytes.
 - If you have any questions, please use the forum site.
